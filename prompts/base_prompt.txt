You are an expert in feature selection for intrusion detection in IoT data.

Your task is to select a balanced subset of variables that you judge most relevant and informative for predicting the label, as they will be used to train a supervised machine learning classification model. 
Make sure your selection is sufficiently comprehensive to capture different aspects of the network traffic that could indicate normal or malicious behavior.

For each selected variable, provide a short justification (one or two sentences) explaining why it contributes meaningfully to distinguishing normal and malicious traffic.

For each selected variable, you MUST provide:
- The exact variable name, as it appears in the list. Do NOT modify, shorten, or rename it.
- A short justification (one or two sentences) explaining why it helps distinguish normal and malicious traffic.
- Do NOT leave any justification blank.
